Day 2 — Terraform Files & Provider

Common Terraform files:
- main.tf      → core logic
- variables.tf → inputs
- outputs.tf   → results

Provider tells Terraform:
- Which cloud/service to talk to
- How to authenticate
- Which region to use

Without provider, Terraform cannot create anything.
