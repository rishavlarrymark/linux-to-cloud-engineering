# 📘 DAY 1 — LINUX ARCHITECTURE + VM SETUP (Full Notebook Notes, Clean Version)

# 🔥 Day 1 Oath (Linux Beginner Oath)

# 

# “Today I step into Linux.

# I understand the foundation, I respect the kernel,

# and I will master the shell.”

# 

# 🧠 1. Linux Architecture Basics

# 

# Linux has two major parts:

# 

# 1\. Kernel (Heart of Linux)

# 

# Controls hardware

# 

# Manages CPU, memory, devices

# 

# Provides system calls to userspace

# 

# Always running in background

# 

# 2\. Userspace

# 

# Where users work (apps, commands, GUI)

# 

# Shells like bash, scripts, tools

# 

# Cannot directly access hardware

# 

# Communicates via kernel

# 

# 👉 Simple Line:

# Kernel = power + control

# Userspace = your workspace

# 

# 🖥️ 2. What You Did Today (VM Setup)

# 

# ✔ Downloaded Ubuntu ISO

# ✔ Installed VirtualBox

# ✔ Created Linux VM

# ✔ Booted Linux for first time

# ✔ Updated OS

# ✔ Installed basic tools (curl, wget, git, vim)

# 

# This creates your Linux practice lab.

# 

# 📝 3. Basic Day 1 Commands

# 1\. hostname — Show system name

# 2\. uname -a — Show kernel + system info

# 3\. whoami — Current logged user

# 4\. pwd — Current directory

# 5\. ls — List files

# 6\. date — Show system date/time

# 7\. echo — Print text

# 8\. cd — Change directory

# 9\. lsb\_release -a — OS version

# 10\. free -h — Memory usage

# 11\. df -h — Disk usage

# 12\. ip -br a — Network info

# 13\. ps aux — Running processes

# 14\. sudo apt update — Update packages

# 15\. sudo apt upgrade -y — Upgrade system

# 

# These are the first tools every DevOps engineer learns.

# 

# 🎯 4. Core Idea of Day 1

# 

# ✔ Linux = Kernel + Userspace

# ✔ You installed your own Linux system

# ✔ You learned the most basic commands

# ✔ You prepared for real DevOps/Linux work

# 

# ❤️ Day 1 Complete.
