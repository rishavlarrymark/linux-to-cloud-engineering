# 📘 DAY 0 — LINUX FOUNDATION (IN-SHORT)

## 🔥 Day 0 Oath
- Linux foundation first  
- Kernel respected  
- Shell mastered  

---

## 🧠 1. Linux Architecture (In-Short)
- **Kernel** → hardware control, memory, CPU, system core  
- **Userspace** → apps, shell, tools, user work  
- Userspace talks to hardware **only via kernel**

**Lock:** Kernel = control | Userspace = work area

---

## 🖥️ 2. Environment Setup (In-Short)
- Linux installed via **Ubuntu VM (VirtualBox)**  
- Linux installed via **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**  
- Ubuntu environment booted & updated  
- Basic developer tools installed  

**Result:** Safe Linux practice lab (VM + WSL)

---

## 🎯 3. Purpose of Day 0 (In-Short)
- Understand what Linux **is**, not commands  
- Separate **kernel vs userspace** mentally  
- Prepare system before real work  

---

## ❤️ DAY 0 LOCK
Foundation ready.  
From next day → execution, not exploration.
